# ben-and-jerrys-promos
New iteration with independant web scraper and react front end, to avoid hosting costs on AWS :innocent:

Live site is a work in progress, I still need to set up automatic refresh of the webscraping on my own hardware (ras-pi), so currently the live site is just using a manual grab of data from a couple weeks ago.

I haven't got around to updating UI either so it's still very basic but at least mobile friendly. :iphone:

Uses my own react template to start with, which can be found [here](https://github.com/lynchdean/template-react) or in my github repos.
